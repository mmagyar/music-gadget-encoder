# Music gadget base on STM32G070 MCU

# Modes of operation
 - Step sequencer
 - Midi controller
 
# Software
This project is built on a basic STM32Cube generated base, with using LL drivers.
TrueSTUDIO for STM32 is used for building and debugging.


# Hardware
The schematics and the pcb is designed with KiCad.
This is not a pcb that can be easily done at home, but most cheap chinease pcb manufaturers will be able to make them for you.
It uses 0805 SMD components, soldering this together is not for beginner.
